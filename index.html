Sustainable economic growth refers to the consistent development of an economy, focusing on long-term strategies to balance economic,
environmental and social needs that promote economic stability to meet current needs without compromising the need for future 
generations to meet their own. The Covid-19 Pandemic significantly hindered economic growth worldwide. This was primarily due to the 
global lockdowns around the world, causing supply chain disruptions and reduced consumer and business activity. Industries such as travel,
retail and hospitality experienced severe declines in demand which resulted in significant unemployment and a substantial decline in economic
growth, as firms resorted to layoffs or shut down their businesses entirely. Recently, Artificial Intelligence has served as a powerful tool 
in this process, by improving efficiency particularly in the fields of finance, healthcare, transportation and resource manufacturing. It is
expected for AI to deliver additional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030, increasing global GDP by about 1.2% annually. 
(McKinsey Global Institute, 2018) 

Finance
One way superintelligent AI has contributed to economic growth in the financial sector is through algorithmic trading which has vastly improved
the decision-making process by analysing large amounts of data from market trends and price discrepancies, enabling faster and more accurate 
transactions. Additionally, AI-driven tools enhance fraud detection for companies such as PayPal and HSBC, by identifying anomalies in transactions
to help protect assets and maintain seamless functionality thus boosting productivity and optimising resource efficiency, leading to an increase in 
real GDP, and therefore a strong economy positioned for long run sustainability. Following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for 
‘artificial intelligence’ skills broadly tripled by mid-2024. (Schubert and Eisfeldt, 2024). This demonstrates how the release of AI such as ChatGPT 
acted as a catalyst for further AI adoptionin many industries, but specifically how it has boosted productivity in the field of finance. 

Healthcare
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare services primarily relied on traditional systems such as standard face-to-face interactions and in-person 
diagnostics, which often led to challenges such as inefficient patient management, prolonged wait times and delayed diagnoses. In post-COVID-19 world, 
healthcare services with the integration of AI have been increasingly growing in developed countries such as The United States and South Korea, as 
opposed to developing countries such as Thailand due to the need for advanced resources and facilities, such as reliable infrastructure and Internet of 
Things (IOT). (Chakraborty, 2023, pp 29-58). 

Conclusion
To conclude, the integration of Artificial Intelligence has been seen to be a significant factor in driving economic growth by improving productivity 
and efficiency across various industries, allowing businesses to respond more effectively to consumer demands and evolving market conditions as a result.
Additionally, this development has created many job opportunities, boosting the country’s competitive advantage and further driving substantial economic 
growth.
