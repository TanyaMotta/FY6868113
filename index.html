      <h3 style="font-size: 26px;"><b>Introduction</b></h3>
         <p> 
Sustainable economic growth refers to the consistent development of an economy, focusing on long-term strategies to balance economic, environmental and social needs that promote economic stability to meet current needs without compromising the need for future generations to meet their own. The Covid-19 Pandemic significantly hindered economic growth worldwide. This was primarily due to the global lockdowns around the world, causing supply chain disruptions and reduced consumer and business activity. Industries such as travel, retail and hospitality experienced severe declines in demand which resulted in significant unemployment and a substantial decline in economic growth, as firms resorted to layoffs or shut down their businesses entirely. Recently, Artificial Intelligence has served as a powerful tool in this process, by improving efficiency particularly in the fields of finance, healthcare, transportation and resource manufacturing. It is expected for AI to deliver additional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030, increasing global GDP by about 1.2% annually. (McKinsey Global Institute, 2018)

      <h3 style="font-size: 24px;"><b>Analysis and Discussion</b></h3>
      <h4 style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Finance</u></h4>
      <p>
Particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, the crisis increased the adoption of Artificial Intelligence in financial institutions as they faced unprecedented challenges such as market volatility. AI-driven tools such as predictive analytics and fraud detection allowed better risk management in the field of Finance.  Despite this, figure <a href="#Figure 1"><b>[1]</b></a> shows that a significant proportion of the banks surveyed by the Bank of England are not spending more on AI and that 12% of banks plan to reduce funding for future adoptions of AI. (Brugel, 2021) This suggest that while A1 adoption has been proven beneficial for both growth in the economy and in managing challenges such as market volatility, there may still be concerns about the long-term investments in the technologies due to uncertainty in the economy. Another way superintelligent AI has contributed to economic growth in the financial sector is through algorithmic trading which has vastly improved the decision-making process by analysing large amounts of data from market trends and price discrepancies, enabling faster and more accurate transactions. Additionally, AI-driven tools enhance fraud detection for companies such as PayPal and HSBC, by identifying anomalies in transactions to help protect assets and maintain seamless functionality thus boosting productivity and optimising resource efficiency, leading to an increase in real GDP, and therefore a strong economy positioned for long run sustainability. Following the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, demand for ‘artificial intelligence’ skills broadly tripled by mid-2024. (Schubert and Eisfeldt, 2024). This demonstrates how the release of AI such as ChatGPT acted as a catalyst for further AI adoption in many industries, but specifically how it has boosted productivity in the field of finance.  
      </p>
      <h5 style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Healthcare</u></h5>
      <p>
Before the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare services primarily relied on traditional systems such as standard face to face interactions and in-person diagnostics, which often led to challenges such as insufficient patient management, prolonged wait times and delayed diagnostics. The reliance on these systems contributed to slowed economic growth from this sector due to inefficiencies that not only increased operational costs, but also resulted in poorer health in society, escalating the strain on healthcare services and decreasing overall productivity in society because of high absenteeism in most sectors of work.  After the COVID-19 pandemic, the healthcare sector experienced a transformative shift with the integration of Artificial Intelligence. Machine learning algorithms became pivotal for analysing large amounts of data on patients to improve diagnostics etc. AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants also supported this growth by providing patients with 24/7 guidance and answering common health inquiries they may have at any time. These advancements led to significant economic growth particularly in developed countries such as The United States and South Korea as these countries had the advanced technology and resources needed to successfully use to improve productivity and efficiency in the field. However, this is not the case for many developing countries such as Thailand due to limited technological resources and infrastructure and specifically in healthcare, the Internet of Things (IOT). (Chakraborty, 2023, pp 29-58).  
      </p>
<h6 style="font-size: 20px;"><u>Conclusion</u><h6>
<p>To conclude, the integration of Artificial Intelligence has been seen to be a significant factor in economic growth by improving productivity and efficiency across various industries. The use of Artificial Intelligence such as virtual health assistants and ChatGPT have allowed businesses to respond more effectively to consumer demands and evolving market conditions as a result. Additionally, this development has increased the demand for degrees in tech-related fields as there is a growing demand for professionals with skills in areas such as machine learning, data science and robotics, therefore creating many job opportunities, boosting the country’s competitive advantage which attracts global investment, further expanding the economy, particularly in developed countries.
